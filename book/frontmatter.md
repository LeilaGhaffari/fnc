This is a beta version of Chapters 1-6 of the textbook [Fundamentals of Numerical Computation](https://tobydriscoll.net/fnc) by Tobin A. Driscoll and Richard J. Braun. The book was originally written for MATLAB, but this resource is being adapted to suit Julia. As of summer 2020, however, that aspect of the book has not been field-tested.
